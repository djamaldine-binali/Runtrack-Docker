```sh
ls

When we want to list files and directory in our current location we use this command, it allows us to see all of them.

```sh
cd
```

The `cd` command can be used in many ways to acces files, one of which is to access those who are in current location. 
Here, we start from the location "C:\Users\dbina\.vscode\Job_02" in which we can see using `ls` a file named welcome-to-docker . We access it simply by writing the file name after the command.

It's a plain text file used by Docker to specify files and/or directories that should be ignored when building an image. It presents itself like so in ours :
